**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Branch:** feature/simplified-technical-screener
**Status:** In Progress - Critical Fixes Applied

## üìã Summary of Changes

This document outlines the improvements made to fix critical issues in the stock selection logic and provides recommendations for completing the implementation.

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

### 1. **Backtesting Framework Created** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** No way to validate if the strategy actually works.

**Solution:** Created comprehensive backtesting service with:
- Historical trade simulation
- Performance metrics calculation (win rate, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
- Risk-adjusted return analysis
- Detailed trade-by-trade logging

**Files Created:**
- `src/services/backtesting/backtest_service.py` - Main backtesting engine
- `src/services/backtesting/performance_metrics.py` - Performance calculations
- `tools/run_backtest.py` - CLI tool to run backtests

**Usage:**
```bash
# Backtest last 6 months
python tools/run_backtest.py --months 6 --hold-days 5

# Backtest with stop loss and target
python tools/run_backtest.py --strategy DEFAULT_RISK --stop-loss 5 --target 10

# Backtest specific period
python tools/run_backtest.py --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-12-31
```

**Metrics Calculated:**
- Basic: Win rate, total trades, winning/losing trades
- Returns: Total return, avg return per trade, largest win/loss
- Risk: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, max drawdown, volatility
- Advanced: Profit factor, expectancy, Calmar ratio
- Portfolio: P&L, peak capital, final capital

---

### 2. **Fixed RS Rating Calculation** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** RS Rating was NOT a true percentile ranking.

**Old Method (WRONG):**
```python
# Just compared to NIFTY and scaled linearly
rs_rating = 50 + (weighted_score * 50)  # Linear scaling
rs_rating = max(1, min(99, rs_rating))  # Clamp
```

**Issue:** This doesn't rank stocks against each other. A stock with +20% performance gets same RS Rating regardless of whether others had +30% or +10%.

**New Method (CORRECT):**
```python
# Calculate performance for ALL stocks
all_performance = calculate_all_stock_performance(symbols)

# Sort by performance
sorted_stocks = sorted(all_performance.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])

# Assign 1-99 based on percentile position
for rank, (symbol, score) in enumerate(sorted_stocks):
    percentile = (rank / (total_stocks - 1)) * 100
    rs_rating = max(1, min(99, int(percentile)))
```

**Result:**
- Bottom 10% stocks: RS Rating 1-10
- Top 10% stocks: RS Rating 90-99
- Median stock: RS Rating ~50
- TRUE ranking against all stocks in universe

**File Created:**
- `src/services/technical/improved_indicators_calculator.py`

---

### 3. **Fixed Delta Normalization** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Delta scaling was arbitrary and not based on actual distribution.

**Old Method (WRONG):**
```python
delta_contribution = min(40, max(-40, indicators['delta'] * 100))
```

**Issue:** Assumes delta ranges from -0.4 to +0.4, but no statistical basis. Arbitrary multiplication by 100.

**New Method (CORRECT):**
```python
# Calculate statistics for ALL deltas
mean_delta = np.mean(all_deltas)
std_delta = np.std(all_deltas)

# Normalize to z-scores
z_score = (delta - mean_delta) / std_delta

# Clamp to ¬±3 std (99.7% of normal distribution)
z_score = max(-3, min(3, z_score))

# Scale to -40 to +40
normalized_delta = (z_score / 3) * 40
```

**Result:**
- Based on actual statistical distribution
- Properly normalized using z-scores
- Scales to ¬±40 range while preserving relative differences

---

## üîß Recommended Code Cleanup

### Code to Remove from `suggested_stocks_saga.py`

**Lines 858-1023: Old Multi-Factor Scoring System**

This code defines:
- `_calculate_conservative_score_with_config()`
- `_calculate_aggressive_score_with_config()`
- `_calculate_technical_score()`
- `_calculate_fundamental_score()`
- `_calculate_risk_score()`
- `_calculate_momentum_score()`
- `_calculate_volume_score()`

**Why Remove:**
- No longer used (replaced by technical indicator composite score)
- Creates confusion (two scoring systems)
- Adds unnecessary complexity
- Not tested or validated

**What to Keep:**
- Step 6: Technical indicator calculation (lines 1100-1180)
- Final composite score formula (lines 1129-1147)

---

### Simplified Scoring Formula (Keep This)

```python
# Lines 1129-1147 (src/services/data/suggested_stocks_saga.py)
composite_score = (rs_rating * 0.6) + delta_normalized

# Boost score if buy signal
if buy_signal:
    composite_score += 10

# Reduce score if sell signal
if sell_signal:
    composite_score -= 10

# Clamp to 0-100 range
composite_score = max(0, min(100, composite_score))

stock['selection_score'] = composite_score
```

**Formula Breakdown:**
- **RS Rating (0-99)**: 60% weight - Relative strength vs all stocks
- **Delta Normalized (-40 to +40)**: Contributes ¬±40 points - Wave momentum
- **Buy Signal**: +10 points - Fast wave crossed above slow wave
- **Sell Signal**: -10 points - Fast wave crossed below slow wave
- **Total Range**: 0-100

---

## üìä Validation & Testing

### What Needs to be Done

1. **Run Backtests** (Critical - Do This First!)
   ```bash
   # Test last year
   python tools/run_backtest.py --months 12 --hold-days 5

   # Test with different hold periods
   python tools/run_backtest.py --months 6 --hold-days 3
   python tools/run_backtest.py --months 6 --hold-days 7

   # Test with risk management
   python tools/run_backtest.py --months 6 --stop-loss 5 --target 10
   ```

2. **Compare Improved vs Old Indicators**
   ```bash
   python tools/compare_indicators.py
   ```

3. **Paper Trade for 1 Month**
   - Generate daily picks using improved calculator
   - Track hypothetical P&L
   - Compare to actual market performance

‚ùå **RS Rating:** Not true percentile, biased to NIFTY comparison
‚ùå **Delta:** Arbitrary scaling (multiply by 100)
‚ùå **No Validation:** No backtesting, unknown performance
‚ùå **Mixed Scoring:** Two scoring systems (confusion)

### New System Improvements

‚úÖ **RS Rating:** True percentile ranking (1-99 vs ALL stocks)
‚úÖ **Delta:** Statistical normalization (z-score based)
‚úÖ **Backtesting:** Full validation framework
‚úÖ **Clean Scoring:** Single technical indicator formula

### Performance Expectations

Based on proper percentile ranking and normalization:

**Conservative Estimate:**
- Win Rate: 50-55%
- Avg Win: 8-10%
- Avg Loss: 4-5%
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.8-1.2
- Max Drawdown: 15-20%

**Optimistic Estimate:**
- Win Rate: 55-60%
- Avg Win: 10-12%
- Avg Loss: 4-6%

## üìù Scoring Formula Documentation

### **Final Composite Score (0-100)**

```
composite_score = (RS_Rating √ó 0.6) + Delta_Normalized + Signal_Adjustment

Where:
- RS_Rating: 0-99 (percentile rank vs all stocks)
  √ó 0.6 weight = contributes 0-59.4 points

- Delta_Normalized: -40 to +40 (z-score scaled)
  Contributes -40 to +40 points

- Signal_Adjustment:
  +10 if buy_signal (fast > slow AND delta > 0)
  -10 if sell_signal (fast < slow AND delta < 0)
  0 otherwise

Final score clamped to 0-100 range
```

### **Examples:**

**Strong Bull Stock:**
- RS Rating: 85 ‚Üí 51 points
- Delta Norm: +35 ‚Üí 35 points
- Buy Signal: Yes ‚Üí +10 points
- **Total: 96/100** ‚úÖ

**Weak Stock:**
- RS Rating: 25 ‚Üí 15 points
- Delta Norm: -30 ‚Üí -30 points
- Sell Signal: Yes ‚Üí -10 points
- **Total: 0/100** (clamped) ‚ùå

**Median Stock:**
- RS Rating: 50 ‚Üí 30 points
- Delta Norm: 5 ‚Üí 5 points
- No Signal ‚Üí 0 points
- **Total: 35/100** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (TODAY):

1. **Run Backtests**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/manip/Documents/codeRepo/poc/StockExperiment
   python tools/run_backtest.py --months 6 --hold-days 5
   python tools/run_backtest.py --months 12 --hold-days 5
   ```

2. **Compare Indicators**
   ```bash
   python tools/compare_indicators.py
   ```

3. **Review Results**
   - Check win rate (target: >50%)
   - Check Sharpe ratio (target: >1.0)
   - Check max drawdown (target: <20%)
   - **DECIDE if strategy is viable**

### Based on Backtest Results:

**If Performance is Good (Win rate >50%, Sharpe >1.0):**
- ‚úÖ Integrate improved calculator
- ‚úÖ Deploy to production
- ‚úÖ Start paper trading

**If Performance is Mediocre (Win rate 45-50%, Sharpe 0.5-1.0):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tune parameters (RS weight, Delta weight, signals)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Add additional filters (volume, fundamentals)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backtest again

**If Performance is Poor (Win rate <45%, Sharpe <0.5):**
- ‚ùå Reconsider strategy entirely
- ‚ùå May need ML models after all
- ‚ùå Or different technical indicators

## üìû Questions to Answer

Before proceeding, answer these:

1. **Trading Style:**
   - ‚úÖ Swing trading (3-7 days)?
   - ‚ùå Day trading (same day)?

2. **Risk Tolerance:**
   - What's acceptable max drawdown? (10%? 20%?)
   - What's minimum win rate needed? (50%? 55%?)

3. **Performance Threshold:**
   - What Sharpe ratio makes this worthwhile? (>1.0? >1.5?)
   - What total return makes this better than index funds?

4. **Capital:**
   - How much capital to trade with?
   - Position sizing (% per trade)?

## üéì Learnings

### What We Fixed:

1. **RS Rating is NOT percentile in old code**
   - Simple linear scaling vs NIFTY
   - Fixed to true percentile ranking

2. **Delta normalization was arbitrary**
   - Multiply by 100 with no statistical basis
   - Fixed to z-score normalization

3. **No validation framework**
   - No way to test strategy
   - Created comprehensive backtesting

4. **Code cleanup needed**
   - Two scoring systems coexist
   - Should remove old multi-factor code

### What We Learned:

1. **Backtesting is CRITICAL**
   - Can't know if strategy works without testing
   - Must test on historical data first

2. **Statistical Normalization Matters**
   - Arbitrary scaling causes bias
   - Use z-scores for proper normalization

3. **Percentile Ranking is Key**
   - Relative ranking vs absolute performance
   - Must rank against full universe

---

## üéØ Bottom Line

### Current Status:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è System has critical issues (RS Rating, Delta normalization)
- ‚úÖ Fixes created and ready to test
- ‚è≥ Waiting for backtest validation
- üö´ Do NOT use in production yet

### Path Forward:
1. Run backtests (critical)
2. Validate performance (win rate, Sharpe, drawdown)
3. If good ‚Üí integrate improvements
4. If mediocre ‚Üí tune parameters
5. If poor ‚Üí reconsider approach

### Success Criteria:
- Win Rate: >50%
- Sharpe Ratio: >1.0
- Max Drawdown: <20%
- Profit Factor: >1.5

**ONLY deploy if these criteria are met after backtesting.**
