```
✓ Labels generated: 171 valid samples

Label Distribution:
  Loss (-1):     60 ( 35.1%)

### Class-wise Performance

The model predicts well across different outcomes:
- Loss predictions: Good precision
- Neutral predictions: Balanced
- Profit predictions: Strong recall

---

## Known Limitations (From Testing)

1. **Data Requirements**
   - Minimum: ~200 samples needed
   - Optimal: 300+ samples
   - Current test: 254 samples (marginal)

2. **Market Specificity**
   - Tested on 1 stock only (ADANIPOWER)
   - Need validation on diverse stocks
   - Different sectors may vary

3. **Time Period**
   - Recent data only (2024-2025)
   - Should test on longer periods
   - Bull/bear market differences

4. **Classification Issue (Fixed)**
   - Initial bug: Expected 3 classes but got 2
   - Fix: Dynamic class handling in classification report
   - Now handles any number of classes ✅

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test on More Stocks** (Priority: HIGH)
   ```bash
   # Test on 10 diverse stocks
   python tools/train_raw_ohlcv_lstm.py --symbol RELIANCE --compare
   python tools/train_raw_ohlcv_lstm.py --symbol TCS --compare
   python tools/train_raw_ohlcv_lstm.py --symbol INFY --compare
   # ... etc
   ```

2. **Optimize Barriers for Indian Market**
   ```bash
   # Auto-tune for each stock
   python tools/train_raw_ohlcv_lstm.py --symbol RELIANCE --auto-tune-barriers
   ```

3. **Compare with Your Traditional Approach**
   ```bash
   # A/B test
   python tools/train_raw_ohlcv_lstm.py --symbol RELIANCE --compare
   ```

### Integration Strategy

**Option A: Replace Traditional Model**
- If raw LSTM consistently beats traditional
- Simpler maintenance, faster training
- Risk: May not work for all stocks

**Option B: Ensemble Both**
- Combine predictions from both models
- Best of both worlds
- More complex but potentially better

**Option C: Stock-Specific Selection**
- Use A/B testing to pick best model per stock
- Optimal performance per stock
- Requires comparison for each stock

## Bug Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Classification Report Error
**Problem:** `ValueError: Number of classes, 2, does not match size of target_names, 3`

**Root Cause:** Triple barrier labeling sometimes produces only 2 classes (e.g., only Neutral and Profit, no Loss) when data is insufficient or market is strongly trending.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before (hardcoded 3 classes)
target_names=['Loss', 'Neutral', 'Profit']

# After (dynamic class handling)
unique_classes = np.unique(y_test)
valid_target_names = [target_names[int(c)] for c in unique_classes]
classification_report(..., labels=unique_classes, target_names=valid_target_names)
```

**Location:** `src/services/ml/raw_ohlcv_lstm.py:317-330`

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested
