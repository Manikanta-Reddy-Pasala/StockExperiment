# Automated Trading System Design Document

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the design of a Python-based automated trading system that selects momentum stocks and places, modifies, and exits trades on Indian exchanges through the Zerodha Kite Connect API. The system will operate in two modes: development (paper-trading simulation) and production (live trading).

### 1.2 Goals
- Build a robust automated trading system for Indian markets using Zerodha Kite Connect API
- Implement momentum-based stock selection strategies with configurable parameters
- Support both paper-trading (simulation) and live trading modes
- Ensure compliance with SEBI's retail algo trading regulations
- Provide comprehensive risk management and audit logging capabilities

### 1.3 Key Features
- Integration with Zerodha Kite Connect for market data and order execution
- Pluggable momentum stock selection engine with multiple strategies
- Comprehensive risk management with position sizing and exposure controls
- Dual-mode operation (development/simulation and production)
- Compliance with SEBI retail algo trading framework
- Real-time monitoring, alerting, and reporting capabilities
- Web-based user interface with real-time dashboard (Flask)
- Detailed performance reporting (daily, weekly, and cumulative P&L)
- Order execution tracking and status monitoring
- Stock selection visualization and strategy insights
- Email alerting for critical events and system notifications
- Manual override capabilities through web interface
- Configuration management via web UI
