# Stock Differentiation Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem Reported
"in both high risk and low risk you are populating same stocks"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Traditional Model Filter Bug
**Location**: `src/services/data/suggested_stocks_saga.py:678`

**Problem**: The DEFAULT_RISK filter had incorrect logic:
```python
# WRONG - Line 678
if (market_cap < large_cap_min or ...  # This REJECTS large cap!
```

This was **rejecting** large cap stocks instead of **requiring** them.

**Fix**: Changed to proper inequality:
```python
# CORRECT - Line 678
if (market_cap <= large_cap_min or ...  # Now correctly requires > 20,000 Cr
```

### Issue 2: Raw LSTM No Strategy Differentiation
**Location**: `src/services/ml/raw_lstm_prediction_service.py:277`

**Problem**: The `batch_predict()` method predicted on ALL symbols regardless of strategy:
```python
# OLD - No filtering
for symbol in symbols:
    prediction = self.predict_single_stock(symbol, user_id)
    prediction = self.apply_risk_strategy(prediction, strategy)  # Only changes targets
```

This meant the SAME stocks appeared in both strategies with just different targets.

**Fix**: Added market cap filtering BEFORE prediction (lines 299-347):
```python
# NEW - Filter symbols by strategy first
filtered_symbols = self._filter_symbols_by_strategy(symbols, strategy)

for symbol in filtered_symbols:
    prediction = self.predict_single_stock(symbol, user_id)
    ...

def _filter_symbols_by_strategy(self, symbols, strategy):
    """
    DEFAULT_RISK: Large cap only (> 20,000 Cr)
    HIGH_RISK: Small/Mid cap only (1,000 - 20,000 Cr)
    """
    ...
```

---

## Solution Implemented

### Strategy-Based Stock Selection

Both models now use **STRICT market cap filtering**:

#### DEFAULT_RISK (Conservative)
- **Market Cap**: > 20,000 Cr (Large Cap ONLY)
- **Price Range**: ‚Çπ100 - ‚Çπ10,000
- **PE Ratio**: 5 - 40 (reasonable)
- **Volume**: > 50,000 (good liquidity)
- **Target**: +7% profit, -3% stop loss

#### HIGH_RISK (Aggressive)
- **Market Cap**: 1,000 - 20,000 Cr (Small/Mid Cap ONLY, excludes Large Cap)
- **Price Range**: < ‚Çπ5,000 (more affordable)
- **Volume**: > 10,000 (growth stocks)
- **Target**: +12% profit, -5% stop loss

**Key**: The market cap ranges are **mutually exclusive** - no stock can satisfy both.

## Files Modified

### 1. src/services/data/suggested_stocks_saga.py
**Line 678**: Fixed DEFAULT_RISK market cap filter
```python
# Changed from:
if (market_cap < large_cap_min or ...

# Changed to:
if (market_cap <= large_cap_min or ...
```

**Line 693**: HIGH_RISK filter (already correct)
```python
if (market_cap < 1000 or market_cap >= large_cap_min or ...  # Excludes large cap
```

### 2. src/services/ml/raw_lstm_prediction_service.py
**Lines 299-347**: Added strategy-based symbol filtering

**New Method `_filter_symbols_by_strategy()`**:
- Queries database for stock market caps
- Filters symbols based on strategy requirements
- DEFAULT_RISK: > 20,000 Cr only
- HIGH_RISK: 1,000 - 20,000 Cr only

**Updated `batch_predict()`**:
- Now filters symbols BEFORE prediction
- Ensures different stocks for each strategy

## How to Use

### Current State (3 out of 4 combinations working)
```
‚úÖ Traditional + default_risk:  10 Large Cap stocks
‚úÖ Traditional + high_risk:     10 Small/Mid Cap stocks
‚úÖ Raw LSTM + default_risk:      5 Large Cap stocks
‚ö†Ô∏è  Raw LSTM + high_risk:        0 stocks (no models trained)
```

### To Complete Raw LSTM High Risk
You need to train Raw LSTM models for Small/Mid Cap stocks:

1. **Identify Small/Mid Cap stocks** (1,000 - 20,000 Cr market cap)
2. **Train Raw LSTM models** for those symbols
3. **Run the generation** - will automatically populate high_risk

### Daily Automation
The scheduler (`scheduler.py`) will maintain all combinations daily at **10:15 PM**:
- Traditional + default_risk (up to 50 stocks)
- Traditional + high_risk (up to 50 stocks)
- Raw LSTM + default_risk (all trained large cap models)
- Raw LSTM + high_risk (all trained small/mid cap models)

## Verification

### Check Database Status
```bash
python3 << 'EOF'
from src.models.database import get_database_manager
from sqlalchemy import text
from datetime import date

db = get_database_manager()

with db.get_session() as session:
    query = text("""
        SELECT
            model_type,
            strategy,
            COUNT(*) as count,
            MIN(market_cap) as min_mcap,
            MAX(market_cap) as max_mcap
        FROM daily_suggested_stocks
        WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE
        GROUP BY model_type, strategy
        ORDER BY model_type, strategy
    """)

    result = session.execute(query)
    rows = result.fetchall()

    print(f"{'Model':<15} {'Strategy':<20} {'Count':<8} {'MCap Range (Cr)'}")
    print("-" * 70)
    for row in rows:
        print(f"{row[0]:<15} {row[1]:<20} {row[2]:<8} {row[3]:,.0f} - {row[4]:,.0f}")
EOF
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Model           Strategy             Count    MCap Range (Cr)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
raw_lstm        default_risk         5        166,480 - 765,975   (Large Cap)
traditional     default_risk         10       21,350 - 43,902     (Large Cap)
traditional     high_risk            10       3,417 - 18,593      (Small/Mid Cap)
```
