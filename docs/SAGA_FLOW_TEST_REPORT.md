# Suggested Stocks Saga - Flow Test Report

**Test Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - ML Training Required

---

## Executive Summary

The Suggested Stocks Saga flow has been partially tested. **Steps 1-2 are working correctly**, but full end-to-end testing requires ML model training which takes 10-15 minutes due to walk-forward cross-validation.

### Key Findings

✅ **Stock Discovery (Step 1) - WORKING**
- Successfully discovers stocks from NSE exchange
- Tested with "NIFTY" search query
- Found 24 matching stocks from database

✅ **Database Filtering (Step 2) - WORKING**
- Successfully filters stocks with complete data
- Verified stocks have technical indicators and historical data
- Sample stocks: MRF, PAGEIND, BOSCHLTD (high market cap)

⏳ **ML Training Required for Steps 3-7**
- Enhanced ML models not pre-trained
- Walk-forward CV training takes 10-15 minutes
- Training on 494,603 samples with 5-fold CV
- Progress observed: Fold 4/5 reached before timeout

## Risk Profile Validation Plan

### DEFAULT_RISK Strategy Criteria
```
Target: Conservative 2-week swing trades
Upside: ~7% target
Stop Loss: 5%
Focus: Large/mid-cap stable stocks

Filters:
- Market cap: > 5,000 Cr (mid-cap minimum)
- P/E Ratio: Reasonable valuation
- Volume: Higher liquidity requirements
- Volatility: Lower risk tolerance
```

### HIGH_RISK Strategy Criteria
```
Target: Aggressive growth potential
Upside: ~12% target
Stop Loss: 10%
Focus: Mid/small-cap growth stocks

Filters:
- Market cap: > 1,000 Cr (lower requirement)
- Volume: Lower liquidity requirement (10,000)
- Volatility: Higher risk tolerance
- Growth: Focus on potential over stability
```

### Expected Differences
- DEFAULT_RISK should have higher average market cap
- HIGH_RISK should have higher average upside %
- Strategies should produce different stock selections
- Some overlap is acceptable (high-quality stocks)

## Database Schema Validation

### Stocks Table
- ✅ All expected columns present
- ✅ No 'industry' column (as expected, only 'sector')
- ✅ Sample data: 20+ stocks with complete information

### Technical Indicators Table
- ✅ Column names verified:
  - `rsi_14` (not `rsi`)
  - `atr_14` (not `atr`)
  - `bb_upper`, `bb_lower` (not `bollinger_upper`)
- ✅ Data present for high market cap stocks

### Historical Data Table

**Purpose:** Comprehensive step-by-step testing
**Status:** Schema issues fixed, ready for retry
**Usage:**
```bash
python3 tools/test_complete_saga_flow.py
```

**Features:**
- Tests each saga step individually
- Compares DEFAULT_RISK vs HIGH_RISK
- Validates strategy differentiation
- Requires ML models to be trained

### 2. `test_risk_profiles.py`
**Purpose:** Focused risk profile comparison

```bash
python3 tools/test_risk_profiles.py
```

**Features:**
- Tests DEFAULT_RISK alone

```

**Benefits:**
- One-time training (10-15 minutes)
- Saga tests run in seconds after
- Recommended before running multiple saga tests

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete ML Training (10-15 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Via training script
   python3 tools/train_ml_first.py

   # Option 2: Via scheduler (runs daily at 10:00 PM)
   # Wait for scheduled training
   ```

2. **Run Risk Profile Tests**
   ```bash
   # After ML training completes:
   python3 tools/test_risk_profiles.py
   ```

3. **Run Complete Flow Test**
   ```bash
   # For comprehensive validation:
   python3 tools/test_complete_saga_flow.py
   ```

### Alternative: Quick Test Without ML

If ML training time is a concern, you can test the flow without ML predictions by temporarily:
1. Skipping Step 6 (ML Prediction)
2. Using mock scores
3. Validating Steps 1-5 and 7

However, this won't validate the complete production flow.

### Production Deployment

For production, ensure:
- ML models are trained nightly at 10:00 PM (via scheduler)
- First-time setup requires initial ML training
- Subsequent saga executions are fast (30-60 seconds)
- Models are refreshed daily with new data

## Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Column Name Mismatches ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Test used generic column names (rsi, atr)
**Resolution:** Updated to actual schema names (rsi_14, atr_14)

### Issue 2: Industry Column Missing ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Test queried non-existent 'industry' column
**Resolution:** Removed industry references, using 'sector' only

### Issue 3: ML Training Time ⚠️ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
**Problem:** Tests timeout waiting for ML training
**Explanation:** Walk-forward CV with 5 folds on 494k samples takes time
**Solutions:**
- Pre-train models once before running tests
- Use scheduler for nightly training
- Accept 10-15 minute training time for accuracy

---
